# Enhanced Document Reminder Strategy

## Current Gaps
1. No immediate notification after payment (waits up to 1 hour)
2. Fixed 2-day intervals might be too long
3. No SMS or phone call integration
4. No automatic case escalation after X reminders

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Immediate Payment Notification
Add immediate document request when payment is confirmed:

```javascript
// In zendesk-webhooks.js after payment confirmation
if (!state.hasDocuments) {
  // Send immediate welcome email with document upload instructions
  await documentReminderService.sendImmediateDocumentRequest(client);
}
```

### 2. Progressive Reminder Schedule
- Day 0: Immediate welcome email after payment
- Day 1: First friendly reminder
- Day 3: Second reminder with urgency
- Day 5: Third reminder + SMS notification
- Day 7: Phone call task for agent
- Day 10: Escalation to supervisor

### 3. Multi-Channel Communication
```javascript
// Add to DocumentReminderService
async sendSMSReminder(client) {
  // Integrate with SMS service (e.g., Twilio)
  // Send short reminder with portal link
}

async createPhoneCallTask(client) {
  // Create high-priority Zendesk ticket for agent call
  // Include call script and client history
}
```

### 4. Automatic Status Updates
```javascript
// Add webhook endpoint for document uploads
app.post('/webhooks/document-uploaded/:clientId', async (req, res) => {
  // Immediately update status
  // Cancel pending reminders
  // Notify agent of upload
});
```

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
Track and display:
- Average time from payment to document upload
- Reminder effectiveness (which reminder # leads to uploads)
- Clients at risk (5+ days without documents)
- Success rate by reminder type

### 6. Smart Reminder Content
Personalize based on:
- Number of previous reminders
- Client's preferred language
- Time since payment
- Document types needed

## Implementation Priority
1. **High**: Immediate notification after payment (prevents waiting)
2. **High**: Progressive reminder schedule (better engagement)
3. **Medium**: SMS integration (reaches clients better)
4. **Medium**: Analytics dashboard (track effectiveness)
5. **Low**: Smart content personalization
