- Added missing ticket_type enum values (payment_review, main_ticket) to Client schema
- Fixed undefined zendeskComment variable reference in payment-confirmed webhook
- Changed to use zendeskTicket variable that is properly defined
- Added safe update fallback when saving zendesk_tickets to handle validation errors
- Added ticket_scenario field to track specific workflow scenarios

This fixes the errors seen when processing payment confirmation webhooks.
